# django_blog
A simple blog for experince 

This is a simple blog made out of the python web framework Django you can view them here -->> https://www.djangoproject.com/
Anyways I plan on expanding this project through out time to eventually create a product people will find usefull in their daily lives.

So About me I am currently 20 years old I am fully self taught I do not code for money obviously because im not 
getting paid for this. I simply enjoy this but with that being said I have been paid to do a few websites for small 
buisnesses and I hope to be employed someday using python and Javascript. Until then I will continue to learn and you can view my code on here
